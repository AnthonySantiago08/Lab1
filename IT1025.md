# Executive Summary
Lab 1 helps define what seperates Information Systems from just being computer science, while also providing some backgrouand on the evolution of Information Systems. While being introduced to these concepts, we are also getting hands on with GitHub and the language of .md. This goes hand-in-hand with the overall picture of IS and we, as a result, get a better understanding of it.
# Information System Components
An information system I use everyday is my smartphone. The hardware includes the phone's screen, casing, battery and tech board inside. The software would include its OS and various apps (including call functionality). Data inside would include your location, time & date, contact information, sound/display setting, etc. The people involved would be me, the people I call and the people who monitor it all. Finally, the processess would include the actual steps to make calls, steps to download apps and maintain internet connectivity.
# GitHub
##### Client-Server
On the client-side, users would input various amonut of information in a business and store it on the hardware, while the server-side allowed multiple users to access the same file/resources thanks to a LAN connection. GitHub desktop is an exapmle of client-server tech: the information you provide by your desktop would be client-side while the information shared among multiple users thanks to the internet is the server-side.
##### Cloud Computing
Most (if not, all) of your information on GitHub is stored on the server-side, and is sharable via server too. My banking app could be considered a 'cloud-computing' enviorment, as all my information is stored soley on the 'cloud' (server). All it ask for me is a simple password.
# Conculsion
This lab has introduced me to the basics of what I need to know about my course, GitHub repository and genreal information system knolwegde. I did have some difficulty at first, but after talking to my instructor I've learned a bit more about the nature of computing as a whole (that is, the computer would do jack unless you tell it to do something exactly how you want it).
