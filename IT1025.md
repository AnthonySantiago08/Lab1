# Executive Summary
Lab 1 helps define what seperates Information Systems from just being computer science, while also providing some backgrouand on the evolution of Information Systems. While being introduced to these concepts, we are also getting hands on with GitHub and the language of .md. This goes hand-in-hand with the overall picture of IS and we, as a result, get a better understanding of it.
# Information System Components
An information system I use everyday is my smartphone. The hardware includes the phone's screen, casing, battery and tech board inside. The software would include its OS and various apps (including call functionality). Data inside would include your location, time & date, contact information, sound/display setting, etc. The people involved would be me, the people I call and the people who monitor it all. Finally, the processess would include the actual steps to make calls, steps to download apps and maintain internet connectivity.
